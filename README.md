# MAD201 - SmartBudgetLite (Full Project)



This repo contains a full React Native (Expo) project structure with the following folders:
- .vscode (settings + extensions)
- app
- assets/images
- components
- constants
- hooks
- scripts
- src/screens

All files contain real code (not blank) so VSCode and Expo will recognize and run the project.

## Quick start
1. npm install
2. npm run start

Replace author details in files as needed.


Assignment aligned to Project 2 requirements.
